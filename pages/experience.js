          <p>With over 15 years in IT, I’ve worn many hats — from hands-on systems administrator to strategic IT manager leading infrastructure overhauls, cross-functional teams, and business-critical initiatives.</p>
          <p>I’ve worked across FinTech, education, and enterprise environments, supporting both fast-growth startups and mature organizations with complex legacy systems. Over the years, I’ve led cloud migrations, designed high-availability networks, and built secure, scalable infrastructure that supports global operations and future growth.</p>
          <p>One of my core strengths is seeing the big picture — aligning technology to business goals, managing cost without compromising performance, and translating complex problems into actionable solutions. I’ve driven initiatives that cut telecom and infrastructure costs by more than 60%, eliminated backlogs of thousands of vulnerabilities, and ensured uptime across production networks through smart design and monitoring.</p>
          <p>I’m also deeply invested in team development. I believe IT should be a trusted partner in every organization — not just fixing issues, but solving problems, driving innovation, and helping people do their best work. I take pride in mentoring engineers, building cross-functional trust, and creating environments where people grow.</p>
          <p>Whether it’s guiding a helpdesk through transformation, deploying enterprise tools like Okta and Amazon Workspaces, or leading through M&A integrations, I bring calm leadership, clear thinking, and an unshakable bias for action.</p>
