            Iâ€™m a strategic, people-first IT Manager with 15+ years of experience leading infrastructure,
            security, and operations across fast-paced environmentsâ€”from FinTech to education. I thrive at
            the intersection of technology and leadership, where clarity, efficiency, and impact matter most.

            Whether modernizing global cloud infrastructure, driving cost-saving initiatives, or mentoring
            high-performing teams, I bring a proactive mindset and a calm, solutions-focused approach to every challenge.
            Iâ€™ve helped organizations streamline IT operations, secure systems, and scale intelligentlyâ€”all while
            keeping people at the center of the process.

            Curious how Iâ€™ve reduced expenses by 66%, cleared massive security backlogs, and led technical transformations across complex environments?
